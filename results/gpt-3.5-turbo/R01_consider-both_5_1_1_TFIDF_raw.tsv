According to Article 717 of the Civil Code, if there is another person who is liable for causing the damage, the possessor or the owner may exercise their right to reimbursement against that person. Therefore, after the possessor of the structure on land has compensated the victim, the possessor may assert his/her right to seek indemnification from the person who is actually responsible for the damage. The right to reimbursement may be based on the degree of fault of the other person and the amount of damages incurred. However, it is important to note that the right to reimbursement is not automatic, and the possessor would need to establish the liability of the other person before they can be entitled to reimbursement.
