Apply the legal principles to the situation: In this case, B's right of retention will depend on whether their possession of the building commenced by means of a tortious act. If B acquired possession of the building through a tortious act, such as theft, embezzlement, or fraud, then they cannot exercise the right of retention under Article 295(2).

Article 304(1) mentions that the holder of a statutory lien may exercise the lien against money that the debtor is to receive as a result of the loss of, or damage to, the subject matter of the lien, provided the holder of the lien must attach the same before the payment or delivery of the money or other thing.\n\n3. Apply the provisions to the query: Based on the provisions of Article 372 and Article 304, it is possible to argue that a mortgagee may also exercise the mortgage against the claim for damage that the debtor is to receive as a result of the loss of the mortgaged property, similar to how a holder of a statutory lien can exercise a lien against the money the debtor is to receive as a result of the loss. However, this assumes that there are no other considerations that may affect the exercise of the mortgage, and further legal research may be needed to verify this conclusion.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'So is the answer yes (Y) or no (N)?

Identify the key facts: In this case, the key facts are that (A) and (B) agreed to a contract for the sale and delivery of a used bicycle; the delivery was scheduled for April 10, and payment was due April 20.\n\n2. Identify the legal issues: The legal issue in this case is whether (A) may refuse the claim of delivery based on the right of defense of simultaneous performance provided by Article 533 of the Civil Code.\n\n3. Analyze the law: Article 533 allows a party to refuse to perform their obligation if the other party has not yet tendered performance of their obligation. In this case, (B) did not tender payment on April 20, which was the due date. Therefore, (A) could argue that they have the right to refuse delivery until (B) tenders payment.\n\n4. Evaluate the application of the law to the facts: Based on the analysis, it appears that (A) may have the right to refuse the claim of delivery based on the right of defense of simultaneous performance. However, it is important to note that the terms of the contract may have an impact on this analysis, and there may be other legal or factual issues that need to be considered.\n\n5.
