Although Article 169 does not specifically mention the right to demand compensation for damages in tort, this right can be considered as falling within the scope of a ""right determined by a final and binding judgment"" in the context of civil law. Therefore, the general rule established by Article 169 would apply to the right to demand compensation for damages in tort if it has been established in an unappealable judgment. Besides, the query explicitly states that the judgment is ""unappealable,"" which further supports the argument that it has the same effect as a final and binding judgment.
