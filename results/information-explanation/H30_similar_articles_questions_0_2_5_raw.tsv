According to Article 94, a false manifestation of intention made in collusion with another person is void. However, the nullity of a manifestation of intention under this provision may not be duly asserted against a third party in good faith. 

Article 101 states that the validity of a manifestation of intention made by an agent to the other party is decided as it concerns the agent, whether or not any fact was present. If an agent who has been entrusted with performing a specific juridical act performs that act, the principal may not assert that the agent did not know of any particular circumstance of which the principal knew.

It also falls under the scope of Article 101, which mentions that the validity of a manifestation of intention can be influenced by fraud, and that a principal cannot assert that the agent did not know of any particular circumstance of which the principal knew. Therefore, the answer to the query is 'Y'.

Based on the information provided in the articles, we know that a false manifestation of intention made by an agent in collusion with the other party is void, according to Article 94. Additionally, Article 101 discusses circumstances under which the validity of a manifestation of intention may be influenced, and it appears that the knowledge or negligence in not knowing of a particular circumstance may be one such circumstance.

Based on this information, it would seem that the counterparty would indeed be able to assert the invalidity of the contract, regardless of whether the principal knew of the false manifestation of intention or not, as long as the false manifestation of intention was made in collusion between the agent and the counterparty.

According to Article 116, ratification is retroactive to the time of the conclusion of the contract unless a particular intention is manifested, provided that this may not prejudice the rights of a third party.\n\nAs for how these concepts relate to the query and the articles, the query asks whether a principal can approve a proxy act performed with conflicting interests after the minor attains the age of majority.

The query asks whether B can bring an action against C for the transfer registration procedure from C to B based on the ownership.

Based on the information provided in the articles, it is clear that A's failure to undertake the ownership transfer registration procedure from A to B means that B does not have legal ownership of the land P, even though B has paid for it. It is also clear that A's undertaking the ownership transfer registration procedure from A to C means that C has legal ownership of the land P. However, the query does not provide enough information to determine whether B can bring an action against C for the transfer registration procedure from C to B based on the ownership.

Article 180 states that possessory rights are acquired by possessing a thing with the intention to do so on one's own behalf. The query states that A's minor child B who is living with A in building P owned by A shall not possess the possessory right of building P.

The articles do not explicitly address this question, but they do provide some information that is relevant to it. Specifically, Article 462(2) states that a person that has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor has the right to reimbursement only to the extent currently enriched. This suggests that a guarantor may become involved in the obligation without the consent of the principal obligor, but it does not provide a clear answer to the question of whether the guarantor may perform the obligation against the will of the principal obligor. Therefore, there is not enough information in the articles to determine whether the query follows logically from them. The answer is 'U'.

Without further clarification or context, it is not possible to determine whether the two statements are logically equivalent. Additionally, the query does not take into account the conditions under which a performance made to an unauthorized person can be effective as outlined in Article 478. Therefore, the answer is 'U'.

However, it is possible to interpret the articles to suggest that a possessor of a leased thing could request reimbursement for useful expenses and increased value, similar to the provisions for borrowed things in Articles 595 and 196. Therefore, the query is partially supported by the articles, but it is not entirely clear whether the lender or owner of the leased thing would be obliged to provide reimbursement. Given the possible interpretations and lack of clear information, the final answer is 'U'.

The query asks whether B can demand payment from A for the unpaid remuneration to the gardener. The articles do not directly address this specific situation, but they do provide general principles regarding reimbursement, obligations, and compensation. Based on these principles, it is possible to argue that B may not be entitled to demand payment from A for the unpaid remuneration to the gardener, as B did not have any obligation to perform the repair and did so voluntarily.

The question asks whether B can demand payment for the repair expenses from A. 

Based on the legal principles and terminology discussed in the articles, the scenario in the query could potentially be analyzed under the principle of unjust enrichment and Article 702, which discusses the obligation to return unjust enrichment. However, the query does not provide sufficient information to determine whether B can claim reimbursement of the costs for the repair of A's hedge under the laws mentioned in the articles. 

Furthermore, while the query refers to a situation where a part of A's hedge collapsed, it does not provide enough information on why the hedge collapsed or whether B had any obligation to repair it.

A pledge is a type of security interest in which a debtor (pledger) offers something of value (pledge) as collateral to secure a loan or debt.\n\n3.

""A claim and obligation becomes vested in the same person"" means that a person both has a right to claim something and an obligation to pay for that same thing. For example, if A owes B a debt, and then B later owes A a debt, and both debts are of equal value, the debts can be effectively offset against each other and neither party owes the other one anything.\n\n2. The exception to the extinguishment of a claim when it becomes vested in the same person is when such a claim is the subject matter of the right of a third party, meaning that a third party has a legal interest in the claim, and therefore it cannot be extinguished by the vesting of the claim and obligation in the same person.\n\n3. A negotiable instrument payable to order is a written promise to pay a specific amount of money to the person or order (i.e. ""to the order of..."") identified on the instrument. These instruments can be transferred (e.g. through endorsement) from person to person, and the holder of the instrument at the time it is due is entitled to payment.\n\n4. An assignment of a negotiable instrument payable to order is when the holder of the negotiable instrument transfers their rights to someone else.
