The articles establish that an act performed by an agent with qualified legal capacity cannot be rescinded on the grounds of qualified legal capacity, except in certain circumstances, such as when the agent was not authorized to perform the act or when the principal lacked the legal capacity to enter into the contract or perform the act. The query asks whether a contract can be rescinded by the principal after it is performed by an agent with a counterparty, even if the agent had limited capacity. The articles do not provide a clear answer to this question, but they suggest that the contract may be valid if the agent had a legal representative who acted on their behalf. Therefore, there is not enough information in the articles to determine whether the query follows logically from the articles. The answer is 'U'.

Principal is a person who authorizes another person called an ""agent"" to act on their behalf. An agent is a person who is authorized to act on behalf of the principal. Authority refers to the legal power or capacity to act on behalf of someone else. Represent refers to the act of someone acting on behalf of another person or entity. A contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties. Ratification is the process of approving or validating a contract or an obligation that was entered into or performed without proper authority. Refusal refers to the act of declining or rejecting an offer, proposal or request. Counterparty refers to the other party involved in a contract or transaction.\n\n2. Article 113 states that a contract concluded by a person who acts as an agent of another person but has no authority to represent does not bind the principal unless the principal ratifies it. The ratification or refusal to ratify must be communicated to the counterparty in order for it to be valid, except if the counterparty already knows about the ratification or refusal to ratify.\n\nArticle 115 states that a counterparty can rescind a contract that a person without the authority to represent has concluded until the principal ratifies it; however, this does not apply if the counterparty knew at the time of the conclusion of the contract that the agent had no authority to represent.\n\n3. The query is not logically accurate. According to Article 113, if the principal refuses to ratify a contract performed by a person without authority, then it does not bind the principal. However, the principal cannot make it effective by ratification after refusing it. The query seems to suggest that the principal can still make it effective by ratification after refusing it, which is not correct.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Given the above, does the query follow from the articles?

As per the provisions of Article 113, if the principal refused to ratify the contract which was performed by an unauthorized agent, then the principal cannot make it effective by ratification. Therefore, the query seems to be illogical as it is opposite to the provisions stated in Article 113. Hence, the answer is 'N'.

The articles establish the requirements for the creation and transfer of real rights on immovables, the rights of an owner of land, and the legal consequences of a concluded sales contract. The query involves a situation where a sales contract was concluded between A and B, but ownership transfer registration was not undertaken, and then A sold the same land to C and ownership transfer registration was undertaken. The query also involves an action brought by B against C for transfer registration procedure based on ownership. The articles do not explicitly address this specific scenario, but the legal reasoning system can infer that the legal system would require A to transfer ownership to C before C could become the legal owner of the land. Therefore, B would not have a valid claim to the land. Based on this reasoning, the answer is 'N'.

The article discusses Article 177, which deals with the registration of real rights on immovables. While the query addresses the transfer of real rights on immovable property, it does not explicitly reference Article 177. However, the principles discussed in Article 177 are relevant to the query.

The query addresses the requirements for the transfer of real rights concerning immovables, the effect of registration on the assertion of real rights against third parties, and the validity of subsequent sales contracts in the absence of registration of the first sales contract. It also considers the defense of requirement for perfection in case of a dispute over ownership transfer registration. Therefore, the answer is 'Y'.

What does ""limited capacity to act"" mean?\n- ""Limited capacity to act"" refers to the situation in which an individual, such as a minor, does not have full legal capacity to enter into certain contracts or perform certain legal acts due to their age or other factors.\n\n2. What is a ""voidable obligation""?\n- A ""voidable obligation"" is an obligation that can be legally cancelled or rescinded by one of the parties involved due to a legal defect, such as a mistake, fraud, or incapacity to act. When an obligation is voided, the parties are released from their duties under that obligation.\n\n3. What does it mean when a ""guarantor is aware of the cause for voidability""?\n- When a guarantor is ""aware of the cause for voidability"", it means that they know, or should have known, that the obligation they are guaranteeing may be cancelled or rescinded due to a legal defect, such as the limited capacity to act of the principal obligor.\n\n4. What is an ""independent obligation""?\n- An ""independent obligation"" is a separate and distinct obligation assumed by a third party, such as a guarantor, who guarantees the performance of the primary obligation. This means that if the primary obligation is cancelled or rescinded, the third party\'s obligation is not automatically cancelled or rescinded.\n\n5. What does ""subject matter"" refer to?\n- ""Subject matter"" refers to the specific thing or legal right that is the object of an obligation, such as a payment of money, delivery of goods, or performance of a service.\n\n6. What is a ""minor\'s obligation""?\n- A ""minor\'s obligation"" is a legal obligation assumed by a minor, who may have limited capacity to act due to their age. In certain circumstances, a minor may be able to enter into valid contracts and assume legal obligations with the consent of their statutory agent.\n\n7. What does ""consent of statutory agent"" mean?\n- ""Consent of statutory agent"" refers to the legal requirement that a minor obtain the approval of their legal representative, such as a parent or guardian, in order to enter into certain contracts or assume certain legal obligations.\n\n8. What is ""non-performance""?\n- ""Non-performance"" refers to the failure of a party to fulfill their obligations under a contract or legal obligation. This can include a failure to make a payment, deliver goods, or perform a service as required by the terms of the agreement.\n\n9. What is ""rescission""?\n- ""Rescission"" is the legal process of cancelling or rescinding a contract or obligation due to a legal defect, such as mistake, fraud, or incapacity to act. When a contract or obligation is rescinded, the parties are released from their duties and obligations under that agreement.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Given the above, does the query follow from the articles?

The answer to this query follows logically from the articles, specifically from Article 449, which states that if a guarantor is aware of the cause for the voidability of an obligation at the time of entering into the guarantee contract, they are presumed to have assumed an independent obligation of the same subject matter in the event of non-performance or rescission of the obligation. Therefore, the answer to the query is 'Y'.

However, the specific language and context of the query may affect the answer, depending on how it is interpreted.\n\nOverall, the key questions to address in this scenario are about the legal effect of the obligee's release, and whether this would supersede the obligation and preclude the obligor from seeking redress, even if they forgot or were confused about the release.""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Given the above, does the query follow from the articles?

While Article 595 addresses the concept of a borrower bearing the ordinarily necessary expenses of the borrowed thing, the query is specifically asking about useful expenses incurred by a possessor of a leased thing, which is not addressed in the articles. However, Article 196(2) does address the concept of a possessor being reimbursed for beneficial expenses, which may include useful expenses, if there is a current increase in value. Additionally, Article 583(2) addresses the concept of a seller reimbursing a buyer or subsequent acquirer for expenses incurred with respect to immovables.

Therefore, there is not enough information in the articles to determine whether the query follows logically from the articles. The query is asking about a specific scenario that is not explicitly addressed in the articles.

- According to Article 613(1), if A approved the sublease between B and C, then C is liable to pay rent directly to A, to the extent of the scope of the obligation based on the lease between A and B.
- It is stated in the query that C was to pay 120,000 yen per month, which is more than the 100,000 yen per month that B was paying to A. Therefore, it is possible that C is obligated to pay a different amount of rent than B.
- According to Article 613(1), if A approved the sublease between B and C, A may demand that C pay rent directly to A. However, it is not clear from the information provided whether A actually approved the sublease.
- It is not clear from the information provided whether there are any other factors that might affect whether A can demand rent of 120,000 yen per month from C. Therefore, there is not enough information in the articles to determine whether the query follows logically from the articles. The answer is 'U'."

Additionally, there may be other provisions of the law that are relevant to the situation described in the query, such as the law governing inheritance or the law governing security interests.

Therefore, the answer is 'U' (there is not enough information in the articles to determine)."
