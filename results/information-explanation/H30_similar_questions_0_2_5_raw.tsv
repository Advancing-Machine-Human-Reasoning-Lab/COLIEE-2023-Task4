The articles state that a false manifestation of intention made in collusion with another person is void, and that the nullity of a manifestation of intention under this provision cannot be asserted against a third party in good faith. 

However, the articles also state that the validity of a manifestation of intention made by an agent to the other party is decided as it concerns the agent. Therefore, it would depend on whether the counterparty was aware of the collusion or not, since a third party in good faith may not be affected by the nullity of the contract.

Therefore, the answer is 'U'."

The articles establish that an act performed by an agent with qualified legal capacity is binding on the principal and cannot be rescinded on the grounds of qualified legal capacity, except when the agent is acting as a legal representative of another person with qualified legal capacity. The query asks whether a contract can be rescinded by a principal after it is performed by an agent with a counterparty, even if the agent was a person with limited capacity. The articles do not provide a clear answer to this question, but suggest that a contract may be rescinded on the grounds of limited capacity if the person was not acting as a legal representative of another person with qualified legal capacity. Therefore, the answer is 'U' (not enough information in the articles to determine).

- B is now seeking ownership transfer registration from C based on the ownership.

Since ownership transfer registration is a legal process that involves registering the transfer of ownership of immovable property from the seller to the buyer with the relevant authorities, it is important to note that the ownership of the land legally passed to C when the ownership transfer registration was undertaken.

The reason is that the query mentions ""free emphyteusis,"" which is not directly related to the content of Article 270. Article 270 only discusses the rights of farming right holders to pay rent and engage in cultivation or livestock farming on another person's land. 

Therefore, there is not enough information in the articles to determine whether or not free emphyteusis may be established.

However, the query does not explicitly mention a guarantee contract, which is a requirement for the presumption to arise. Additionally, the query does not mention whether the guarantor was aware of the cause for voidability at the time of entering into the guarantee contract. Therefore, there is not enough information in the query to determine whether the presumption of an independent obligation would arise in this situation.

- The query states that if an obligor inherits a claim over which a pledge is created, such claim shall be extinguished.
- There is no clear connection between the query and the articles. The query makes no reference to Article 520 or the rules governing negotiable instruments and pledges that are discussed in the articles. The articles do not provide any specific guidance or context that would allow us to determine whether an obligor's inherited claim would be extinguished in the case of a pledge.
- The fact that a claim and obligation becoming vested in the same person is generally extinguished (per Article 520) and that a pledge is a type of security interest in which a debtor gives an interest in property to secure a debt (per the definition provided) does not necessarily mean that an inherited claim over which a pledge is created would be extinguished.

Therefore, the answer is 'N' (no), as there is not enough information in the articles to support the logical connection between the query and the legal concepts discussed in the articles."
