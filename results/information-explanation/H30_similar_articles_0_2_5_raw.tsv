Examples of juridical persons include corporations, organizations, and associations.\n\n2. Relevant legal principles related to juridical persons: A juridical person is distinct from its members and shareholders, meaning that the actions of the juridical person are not necessarily attributable to its members or shareholders.

While the articles do provide some provisions related to agents, legal representatives, and rescinding voidable acts, none of them specifically address this scenario. Therefore, the answer is 'N'.

According to the articles, a registered lease can be asserted against mortgagees that hold mortgages registered prior to the registration of that lease if all mortgagees that hold those mortgages give their consent and those consents are registered.

Based on the information in the articles, it appears that such assertion is possible. Article 387(1) states that a registered lease may be asserted against mortgagees if all mortgagees that hold those mortgages give their consent and those consents are registered. Further, under Article 387(2), for a mortgagee to give the required consent, the approval of the persons that hold rights for which the mortgage is the subject matter and other persons that will suffer detriment as a result of the consent of the mortgagee must be obtained. However, the query does not provide information on whether the consent of the relevant persons was obtained as required. Therefore, there is not enough information to confirm whether the query follows from the articles. Hence, the final answer is 'U'.

Context and Implications:\n\nArticle 399 states that even something that cannot be given an estimated monetary value may be the subject matter of a claim. This means that a person can make a legal claim for something that is valuable to them, even if it cannot be assigned a specific monetary worth. The article highlights the idea that the law recognizes the importance of non-monetary values, such as sentimental or emotional value, in determining the subject matter of a claim.\n\nThe query, on the other hand, suggests that a matter that cannot be given an estimated monetary value may not be the subject of a claim.

This means that if a guarantor enters into a contract with joint and several liability, they can be held responsible for fulfilling the entire obligation of the principal obligor if the principal obligor fails to do so.\n\n4. No, the release of the principal obligor is not considered a change in the subject matter or terms of the principal obligation under Article 448(2). This provision specifically states that even if the subject matter or terms of the principal obligation are made more onerous after the conclusion of a guarantee contract, the burden of the guarantor remains unchanged. The release of the principal obligor does not make the obligation more onerous for the guarantor, but rather extinguishes it entirely.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Given the above, does the query follow from the articles?

""Joint and several"" is a term used in contractual relationships where parties share obligations or liability. Joint and several guarantors are multiple guarantors who are responsible for the entire obligation rather than just a portion of it. Each guarantor is individually responsible for the whole of the obligation, which means that the creditor can choose to pursue any one or all of the guarantors for the full amount owing.\n2. The obligations of a guarantor may be extinguished in various circumstances. For instance, if the underlying obligation is paid or discharged, then the obligations of the guarantor may also be extinguished. Other circumstances that may extinguish the obligations of the guarantor include a variation of the principal obligation or a release of the principal debtor by the creditor.\n3.

The query concerns the extinguishment of the obligations of a joint and several guarantor when the principal debtor is released from their obligations. While the articles do not directly address this situation, they do establish rules for the reduction of the burden of the guarantor and for the treatment of guarantee contracts. Therefore, it is possible to hypothesize that the obligations of a joint and several guarantor may be extinguished if the principal debtor is released from their obligations. However, this would depend on the specific terms of the guarantee contract and the applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, the final answer is 'U' for uncertain as there is not enough information in the articles to definitively determine whether the query follows logically from them.

The legal rules related to the obligations of the guarantor and principal obligor are set out in various articles of the Civil Code. For example:\n  - Article 448 sets out that the burden of a guarantor is reduced to the extent of the principal obligation if it is more onerous than the principal obligation in terms of subject matter or terms.\n  - Article 452 allows the guarantor to request the obligee to demand performance of the principal obligor first in certain circumstances.\n  - Article 457 provides that the guarantor may assert a defense against the obligee that can be raised by the principal obligor.\n\n2. The legal rules related to joint and several guarantee obligations are set out in Article 551 of the Civil Code. This article indicates that when two or more persons have given a single guarantee for the same obligor and the same obligation, each of the guarantors is subject to joint and several obligations.\n\n3. The legal rules related to the release and extinguishment of obligations are set out in various articles of the Civil Code. For example:\n  - Article 495 sets out the ways in which an obligation may be extinguished, such as by performance or novation.\n  - Article 498 provides that once the principal obligation has been extinguished, the accessory obligation is also extinguished.\n  - Article 464 allows the guarantor to request release from the guarantee obligation if there has been a material alteration of the principal obligation.\n\n4. The query is not entirely accurate. The release of the principal obligor does not necessarily extinguish the joint and several guarantee obligations; instead, each of the guarantors remains liable for the full amount of the obligation. However, if the guarantee obligations are joint obligations, then the release of one of the joint obligors can lead to the discharge of that joint obligation, to the extent of that obligor's share.

- The query asks whether B, who repaired A's hedge without any obligation and against A's intention, may demand payment of the expenses for the repair from A.
- The relevant legal provisions from the articles are Article 650, which deals with the mandatary's right to claim reimbursement of costs and demand performance of obligations, and Article 702, which deals with the manager's right to claim reimbursement of beneficial expenses, demand performance of beneficial obligations, and claim compensation for benevolent intervention in another's business against the will of the principal.
- Applying the relevant legal principles to the facts of the query, it can be concluded that B may not demand payment of the expenses for the repair from A since B repaired the hedge without any obligation and against A's intention, and therefore, B cannot claim reimbursement of expenses, demand performance of obligations, or claim compensation for benevolent intervention in another's business against the will of the principal.

The query posits a particular scenario where a guarantor inherits an obligee, and asks whether the guarantee obligation is extinguished as a result. However, whether or not the guarantee obligation would be extinguished depends on a number of factors, including the language of the guarantee contract and the specific provisions of the Civil Code that apply to guarantee obligations. 

Therefore, I cannot give a final answer of 'Y' or 'N'."
