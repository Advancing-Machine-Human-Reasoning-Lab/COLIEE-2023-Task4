However, the query is specifically asking about the counterparty's ability to assert the invalidity of the contract, not a third party in good faith. 

We also know that the validity of a manifestation of intention made by an agent can be influenced by various factors, including fraud and knowledge, but whether or not any such fact was present is decided as it concerns the agent.

The legal capacity of an agent may vary depending on their authority to act on behalf of the principal. An agent with qualified legal capacity is authorized to represent another person in a particular matter, while an agent with no authority to represent does not bind the principal unless the principal ratifies the contract.\n2. Article 102 states that an act performed by an agent with qualified legal capacity may not be rescinded on the grounds of qualified legal capacity, except for acts performed as a legal representative of another person with qualified legal capacity. However, Article 115 allows a counterparty to rescind a contract that a person without the authority to represent has concluded until the principal ratifies it, provided that the counterparty did not know at the time of the conclusion of the contract that the agent had no authority to represent.\n3. Once a contract is performed by an agent with a counterparty, the principal cannot rescind the contract on the grounds of the agent's limited legal capacity. However, the principal may be able to seek damages or other remedies against the agent for exceeding their authority or acting negligently.\n4. The legal capacity of an agent, along with their authority to represent the principal, can affect the liability of the agent and the counterparty in a contract. If an agent with no authority to represent enters into a contract, the principal is not bound by it unless they ratify the contract. In this case, the agent may be liable to the counterparty for breach of contract or other damages. However, if the counterparty knew or should have known that the agent had no authority to represent, they may not be able to pursue the agent's liability.

Article 180 states that possessory rights are acquired by possessing a thing with the intention to do so on one's own behalf. As the building is owned by ""A"", they have the intention of possessing the building on their own behalf.

However, the articles do mention that a superficiary who has established a free superficies on someone else's land may be required to pay periodical rent to the owner(s) of the land.

Article 242 provides that the owner of immovables acquires ownership of a thing that has been attached thereto as its appurtenance, provided that the rights of the other person that attached that thing by virtue of a title are not prejudiced. Article 703 provides that a person that has benefited from the property or labor of another person without legal cause and has thereby caused a loss to another person bears the duty to return that benefit, to the extent the benefit exists. Article 704 provides that a beneficiary in bad faith must return the benefit received together with interest thereon, and if any damage still remains, the beneficiary is liable to compensate for this.

This means that the owner of the property cannot sell or transfer the property without satisfying the mortgage debt.\n3. When a mortgage is ""terminated"" or ""extinguished,"" it means that the legal claim that the mortgagee had over the property has been removed or canceled. This typically happens when the mortgage debt is repaid in full, or when there is a legal process that allows for the mortgage to be terminated in certain circumstances.\n4. According to Article 378, a third party can terminate a mortgage by paying the price of a mortgaged immovable to the mortgagee if two conditions are met: (a) the third party must purchase the ownership or superficies of the mortgaged immovable from the owner of the property, and (b) the payment must be made at the request of the mortgagee.\n5.

The articles state that a registered lease can be asserted against mortgagees that hold mortgages registered prior to the registration of that lease if all mortgagees that hold those mortgages give their consent and those consents are registered. However, the query does not provide enough information to determine whether the building lease was registered or not. Therefore, the answer is 'U' (not enough information).

Article 705 explicitly states that a person who has paid money or delivered anything as performance of an obligation may not demand the return of the money paid or thing delivered if the person knew, at the time, that the obligation did not exist. Therefore, the query's assumption that the obligor can demand the return of the thing tendered if he/she forgot that he/she was released from the obligation is incorrect. The query also incorrectly assumes that Article 519 applies to cases where the obligor forgot that he/she was released from the obligation, when in fact, it only applies to cases where the obligee manifests the intention to release the obligor from the obligation. Therefore, the final answer is 'N'.

The original loan for use contract is between A and B, and it becomes effective if one party promises to deliver a certain thing, and the other party promises to return the thing when the contract is terminated after the other party gratuitously uses and makes a profit of the borrowed thing.

Based on the information given in the query and the articles, it is not clear whether B can demand compensation for damages due to default by A.

Article 520 states that a claim and obligation become extinguished if they become vested in the same person, but it does not specifically address the situation of inheritance and pledges. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the query follows logically from the articles.

While the articles do discuss the extinguishment of a claim when it becomes vested in the same person as the obligation, this is not directly related to the issue of inheritance or the effect of a pledge on a claim. Therefore, the query cannot be answered definitively based on the articles alone. The answer is 'N'.
