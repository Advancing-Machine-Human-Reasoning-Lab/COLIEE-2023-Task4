Acts that require consent or permission from the curator or assistant:\nUnder Article 13 of the Japanese Civil Code, a person under curatorship must obtain the consent of the curator to perform certain acts, such as receiving or using any property producing civil fruit, borrowing money or guaranteeing an obligation, performing an act with the purpose of acquiring or losing any right regarding immovables or other significant property, and granting a lease for a term that exceeds the period set forth in Article 602. Similarly, under Article 17 of the Civil Code, a person under assistance may be required to obtain the consent of their assistant to perform certain acts, which are restricted to a part of the acts provided for in Article 13, paragraph (1).\n\n3. Procedures for obtaining consent or permission:\nThe person under curatorship or assistance must obtain the consent of their curator or assistant before performing the acts that require such consent. If the curator or assistant does not consent to an act for which the person under curatorship or assistance must obtain their consent, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the curator's or assistant's consent, at the request of the person under curatorship or assistance. \n\n4. Circumstances under which the family court may grant permission in lieu of the curator's or assistant's consent:\nUnder Article 13(3) and Article 17(3) of the Civil Code, if the curator or assistant does not consent to an act for which the person under curatorship or assistance must obtain their consent, even though it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship or assistance, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the curator's or assistant's consent, at the request of the person under curatorship or assistance.\n\n5. Consequences of performing an act without obtaining consent or permission:\nAn act for which the person under curatorship or assistance must obtain the curator's or assistant's consent is voidable if the person performs it without obtaining the curator's or assistant's consent or a permission that operates in lieu of it. This means that the act is not automatically invalid, but can be challenged by the curator or assistant, or by the person under curatorship or assistance themselves. If the act is challenged and found to be voidable, it may be rescinded or cancelled.""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Given the above, does the query follow from the articles?

Based on the information provided in the articles, the answer is 'Y'. Both Article 13 and Article 17 of the Civil Code allow the family court to grant permission in lieu of the curator's or assistant's consent if the act is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under curatorship or assistance. Therefore, if the assistant does not consent to an act for which the person under assistance must obtain the assistant's consent, even though it is unlikely to prejudice the interests of the person under assistance, the family court may grant permission that operates in lieu of the assistant's consent, at the request of the person under assistance.

Based on the information in the articles, we know that foreign juridical persons permitted in Japan possess the same private rights as those possessed by a juridical person of the same kind that has been formed in Japan. However, there may be limitations on the private rights possessed by foreign juridical persons permitted in Japan if there are special provisions in a law or treaty. Additionally, the articles state that a right that a foreign national is not entitled to enjoy may not be possessed by a foreign juridical person permitted in Japan.

Therefore, it is possible that a foreign juridical person permitted in Japan may not possess the same private rights as those possessed by a juridical person of the same kind that has been formed in Japan if those rights are restricted for foreign nationals. However, without more information about the specific rights in question and any applicable laws or treaties, we cannot determine whether the query follows logically from the articles.

Based on the information provided in the articles, it is clear that an action for maintenance of possession can be filed either during the obstruction or within one year after the obstruction stops. However, if the possessed thing has been damaged due to construction work and either one year has passed from the time when the construction was started or the construction has been completed, the action may not be filed.

In the query, it is mentioned that the fence was completed two years after construction started. Since it has been more than one year from the completion of the fence, A may not file an action for maintenance of possession against B.

Therefore, the answer is 'N' as the query does not follow logically from the articles."

- The articles do cover situations where the buyer refuses to accept or is unable to accept the performance of the obligation of delivery by the seller.
- The articles also state that if the subject matter is lost due to any grounds not attributable to either party after the time of delivery or tender of performance, the buyer may not demand cure of the non-conformity of performance, demand a reduction of the price, claim compensation for loss or damage, or cancel the contract on the ground of the loss or damage. 
- However, if the subject matter is lost due to gross negligence of the seller while in the seller's custody, the buyer may not refuse to pay the price.
Therefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer is 'N'. The query suggests that the buyer may not refuse to pay the price if X is lost due to gross negligence of A while in custody of X by A, and B refuses to accept without a legitimate reason. However, the articles state that the buyer may not refuse to pay the price only if the subject matter is lost due to gross negligence of the seller while in the seller's custody, and not in other circumstances.

Therefore, it cannot be concluded from the articles whether a new period of extinctive prescription commences to run at the time when a judgment upholding the demand has become final and binding. Hence, my answer is 'N'.

However, based on the information provided in the query, it seems that the statement is logically consistent with the law in Japan. According to Japanese law, a final and binding judgment upholding a demand for performance of an obligation triggers a new period of extinctive prescription unless the obligee or obligor manifests a particular intention to the contrary.

According to Article 439(1), if one of the joint and several obligors has a claim against the obligee and invokes a set-off, the claim is extinguished for the benefit of all joint and several obligors.

In the case of joint and several obligations, one of the obligors can assert a set-off against another obligor to the extent of their share of the obligation.\n\n4.

The failure to give notice may affect the rights of the other joint and several obligors.\n\n5.

The query is asking if an assignment of a deposit claim subject to a special agreement that it cannot be assigned will not be effective if the assignee was in bad faith or grossly negligent with respect to the special agreement. This question can be answered by combining the provisions of Article 466-5, which provides an exception to the general rule for claims for deposits in a deposit account, with the general rule under Article 466, which allows for the assignment of claims subject to any manifestation of intention to restrict assignment. Furthermore, the articles establish that a special agreement can restrict the assignment of a deposit claim and that the obligor may refuse to perform the obligation to an assignee that knew or did not know due to gross negligence that the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment was made. Therefore, the answer is 'Y'.

The query is concerned with a special agreement that prohibits the assignment of a deposit claim. Article 466(2) states that even if a party to a claim manifests the intention to prohibit or restrict the assignment of the claim, the validity of the assignment of the claim is not impaired. However, Article 466-5(1) provides an exception to this rule for claims for deposits in a deposit account. Under this exception, a manifestation of intention to restrict assignment made with regard to such claims may be duly asserted against a third party assignee that knew or did not know due to gross negligence that the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment was made. 

Therefore, the query's assertion that an assignment of a deposit claim subject to a special agreement may be ineffective if the assignee was in bad faith or grossly negligent with respect to the special agreement follows logically from the articles.

Article 502(1) states that if performance by subrogation occurs with respect to one part of a claim, the subrogee, with the consent of the obligee, may exercise the rights of the subrogee together with the obligee in proportion to the value of the subrogee's performance. The query is asking whether a guarantor who has partially paid a secured claim can independently exercise the secured claim and the security right acquired through subrogation in proportion to the value of the subrogee's performance. Since the articles state that a subrogee may exercise their rights in proportion to the value of their performance, and that a guarantor can independently exercise a secured claim acquired through subrogation, it appears that the query follows logically from the articles.

The query also states that A delays in delivering X after the contract of sale, and Article 538(2) states that if the obligor does not perform the obligation to the third party, the other party to the contract may not cancel the contract without the consent of the third party. Therefore, B may not cancel the contract of sale without G's consent under the given circumstances.

Article 561 establishes the seller's obligation to acquire and transfer the right to the buyer.

Since the buyer knew at the time of the contract that the rights they bought did not belong to the seller, it suggests that it was due to the obligor's failure to perform their obligation of acquiring and transferring those rights. Thus, the buyer can claim for damages in case the seller cannot acquire and transfer the rights. Therefore, I say 'Y'.

What is the concept of ""cancellation"" and the conditions under which it can be effected?\nCancellation refers to the termination or annulment of a contract or agreement. Article 540 specifies that if one of the parties has the right to cancel pursuant to the provisions of the contract or the law, the cancellation is effected by manifestation of intention to the other party. This suggests that cancellation can only be effected if the party has a legal right to do so, as specified in the contract or the law.\n\n2. What is the meaning and implication of ""manifestation of intention"" and ""revocation"" in this context?\nA ""manifestation of intention"" refers to a clear and unambiguous expression of the party\'s intention to cancel the contract. Article 540 specifies that this manifestation of intention may not be revoked, which means that once the party has clearly expressed their intention to cancel, they cannot change their mind and withdraw the cancellation.\n\n3. Are there any relevant legal principles or rules that may apply to the interpretation and application of these terms?\nThere may be legal principles or rules that apply to the interpretation and application of these terms, depending on the specific jurisdiction and context in which the contract was formed. For example, there may be specific requirements for the form or content of the manifestation of intention, or there may be limitations on the circumstances under which cancellation can be effected. It is therefore important to consider the relevant legal framework in order to fully understand the implications of these terms.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Given the above, does the query follow from the articles?

The articles state that the manifestation of intention to cancel may not be revoked, which suggests that once the party has expressed their intention to cancel, they cannot change their mind and withdraw the cancellation. The query simply restates this principle in a slightly different form. Therefore, the answer is 'Y'.
