""Manifestation of intention"" refers to the act of expressing one\'s intention to enter into a legal agreement or transaction.\n2. A manifestation of intention can be voidable if it is based on a mistake wherein the person lacks the intention that corresponds to the manifestation of intention, or a mistake wherein the person making the manifestation of intention holds an understanding that does not correspond to the truth with regard to the circumstances which the person has taken as the basis for the juridical act.\n3. A manifestation of intention based on a mistake can be rescinded if the mistake is material in light of the purpose of the juridical act and common sense in the transaction, and if the circumstances in question are being taken as the basis for the juridical act.\n4. If a mistake is due to gross negligence on the part of the person making the manifestation of intention, that person may not rescind a manifestation of intention as under paragraph (1), except in certain circumstances that involve the other party\'s knowledge or lack of knowledge due to gross negligence or being under the same mistake.\n5.

Article 396 of the Civil Code states that ""no mortgage is extinguished by prescription in relation to obligors and mortgagors unless it is extinguished simultaneously with the claim the mortgage secures.""

The answer to this question is yes, as stated in the second point of the previous answer. 

Additionally, the query asks whether an obligor can assert extinctive prescription if 20 years have passed from the time when it becomes exercisable. The prescription of a mortgage becomes exercisable after 10 years from the time the mortgage was created or registered, as stated in the fourth point of the previous answer. Therefore, the answer to the query is also yes.

The mortgagee may apply the mortgage to secure other claims, or assign or waive that mortgage, or its order of priority, for the benefit of other obligees of the same obligor.\n\n2. The order of priority of mortgages is determined by the chronological order of registration in the registration of the mortgage. A mortgagee may assign or waive the order of priority of the mortgage for the benefit of other obligees of the same obligor.\n\n3. The requirements for the perfection of the disposition of mortgages include notifying the principal obligors or obtaining their consent to the disposition in accordance with the provisions of Article 467. If the principal obligors have received the notice or given the consent, payments made without the consent of the persons who benefit from the disposition of the mortgage may not be duly asserted against those beneficiaries.\n\n4. A revolving mortgage is a type of mortgage that allows the mortgagee to secure a revolving line of credit with the same collateral. The principal of a revolving mortgage is crystallized in certain cases, such as when the revolving mortgagee has filed a petition for auction or execution against earnings from immovable collateral or the attachment for disposition of delinquency against the mortgaged immovables.\n\n5. Before the principal is crystallized, a revolving mortgagee may not dispose of a revolving mortgage under the provisions of Article 376, paragraph (1), but is not precluded from applying that revolving mortgage to secure other claims. The provisions of Article 377, paragraph (2) do not apply to payments made before the principal is crystallized in the cases provided for in the proviso to the preceding paragraph.""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Given the above, does the query follow from the articles?

Article 412-2(1) states that if the performance of an obligation is impossible in light of the contract or other sources of claims and the common sense in the transaction, the obligee may not request the performance of the obligation.

Article 415(1) provides that if the obligor fails to perform consistent with the purpose of the obligation or the performance of an obligation is impossible, the obligee may claim compensation for loss or damage arising from the failure.

Subrogation - Subrogation is a legal mechanism that allows a person who has paid a debt for someone else to step into the shoes of the debtor and enforce the rights and remedies that the debtor would have had against the original obligor. In the context of the articles, subrogation arises when a person performs an obligation for the benefit of the obligor and becomes entitled to the claim of the obligee.\n\n2. Guarantor - A guarantor is a person who promises to pay a debt or perform an obligation if the primary obligor fails to do so. In the context of the articles, a guarantor may be subrogated to the claim of the obligee if the guarantor has a legitimate interest in performing the obligation and the obligee causes the security to be lost or diminished intentionally or negligently.\n\n3. Security - Security refers to a legal interest in property that serves as collateral for a debt or obligation. In the context of the articles, security may be lost or diminished if the obligee intentionally or negligently causes it to be so, and this may affect the subrogation rights of the person entitled to subrogation.\n\n4. Reimbursement - Reimbursement refers to the payment of an amount owed to a person who has incurred expenses or suffered losses on behalf of someone else. In the context of the articles, a person entitled to subrogation may seek reimbursement from the obligor based on the person's own rights.\n\n5. Conditions, Limitations, and Exceptions - The articles contain various conditions, limitations, and exceptions that apply to the legal concepts of subrogation, guarantor, security, and reimbursement. For example, subrogation is allowed only to the extent that the person entitled to subrogation is entitled to seek reimbursement from the obligor. Also, the person entitled to subrogation may be relieved from responsibility if the obligee causes the security to be lost or diminished intentionally or negligently, but this does not apply if the obligee has reasonable grounds in light of the common sense in the transaction for causing such loss or diminution.  \n\nRegarding the query, it is not clear how the language and reasoning in the query relate to the legal principles and rules set forth in the articles.

Therefore, even if a person is delegated to execute business, the partnership business is still decided by the majority of the partners.
