Article 200(2) states that an action for recovery of possession may not be filed against a specific successor of a person that forcibly takes possession, provided that the successor did not have knowledge of the fact that the person has unlawfully taken possession. In the query, C is a specific successor of B, who forcibly took possession of A's computer. However, the query states that C did not know about the theft, so A may not demand the return of the computer by filing an action for recovery of possession. Therefore, the query follows logically from the articles.

According to the articles, a possessor who has been forcibly dispossessed may demand the restitution of the thing and compensation for loss or damage by filing an action for recovery of possession.\n3. Under certain conditions, a possessor can file an action for recovery of possession against a specific successor of a person that has forcibly taken possession. Specifically, if the specific successor had knowledge of the fact that the person unlawfully took the possession, the possessor may file an action against them.\n4. The scenario described in the query involves A leasing a machine tool owned by A, to B. C then steals the machine tool from B within the duration of the lease agreement.\n5. Based on the specific facts of the scenario described in the query, it is unclear whether B has the right to file an action for recovery of possession against C, as it is not mentioned whether C had any knowledge that their act of stealing the machine tool was unlawful.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Given the above, does the query follow from the articles?

The query concerns a situation where B, the possessor, was forcibly dispossessed of a machine tool, and asks whether B can file an action for recovery of possession against C, the person who stole the machine. This question falls squarely within the scope of the definition of 'forcible dispossession' and the legal remedy available to a possessor who has been forcibly dispossessed, as explained in the articles. However, the articles do not provide enough information to answer the specific question of whether B can file an action for recovery of possession against C, as the query does not mention whether C had knowledge that his actions were unlawful. Therefore, the final answer is 'U'.

This question involves the concept of impossibility of performance, which is addressed in Article 412-2. Specifically, Article 412-2(1) states that if the performance of an obligation is impossible in light of the contract or other sources of claims and the common sense in the transaction, the obligee may not request the performance of the obligation. Therefore, if the destruction of the subject matter of the contract makes performance impossible, the contract would not be effective.

However, the query does not explicitly mention whether the parties have agreed on a specific time limit or due date for the performance of the contract, which is addressed in Article 412. If a due date has been assigned to the performance of the obligation, the obligor is liable for delay from the time that due date arrives. Therefore, if the destruction of the subject matter occurs after the due date has passed, the obligor may be liable for delay.

Based on the above analysis, the answer is 'Y'."

This scenario is not specifically addressed in the articles, but the articles provide general principles regarding the performance of obligations and the legal effects of impossibility of performance. Based on these principles, it is possible to infer that if the debt to pay the price of X is extinguished due to the negligence of a third party, and the impossibility of performance is not attributable to either party, then B may refuse to perform counter-performance, i.e. refuse to pay the price for X. Therefore, the answer is 'Y'.

The query asserts that if an obligee (C) files an action concerning demand for rescission of fraudulent act, an obligor (A) must be stood as a defendant. According to Article 424, the obligee may demand the rescission of an act that the obligor commits knowingly to prejudice the obligee. Therefore, the obligor (A) can be held as a defendant in an action concerning demand for rescission of fraudulent act.

The query asks whether D may claim payment to another obligor (A) if D releases another obligor (C) from the obligation, even if neither D nor B manifests a particular intention.

Article 441 states that any circumstances that have arisen with respect to one of the joint and several obligors is not effective in relation to other joint and several obligors unless the obligee and one of the other joint and several obligors manifest a different intention. Therefore, if D manifests the intention to release C from the obligation, it does not automatically release A and B from their obligations, unless D and B manifest a different intention.

In conclusion, there is not enough information in the query to determine whether D may claim payment to another obligor (A) if D releases another obligor (C) from the obligation, even if neither D nor B manifests a particular intention. Therefore, the answer is 'U'."

According to Article 537(1), if one of the parties promises in a contract to render a certain performance to a third party, the third party has the right to claim that performance directly from the obligor. In this case, the contract of sale promises to render ownership of X to a third party (G), and G has manifested intention of availing of the benefit of the contract under Article 537(1) to the obligor (A). Therefore, G has the right to claim ownership of X directly from A.

Furthermore, Article 538(1) states that after rights of the third party have accrued pursuant to the provisions of Article 537(1), the parties may not modify or extinguish those rights. As rights of the third party (G) have accrued pursuant to the provisions of Article 537(1), the parties may not modify or extinguish those rights.

Finally, Article 538(2) states that if the obligor (A) does not perform the obligation to the third party (G), the other party to the contract (B) may not cancel the contract without the consent of the third party (G). Therefore, B may not cancel the contract of sale without G's consent.

The query is based on the provisions of Articles 537 and 538 of the Civil Code of Japan, which provide for the rights of a third party in a contract and the consequences of not performing obligations to a third party.

The query assumes that A has not performed the obligation to deliver X to G, which means that G has the right to claim that performance directly from A under Article 537(1). The query also assumes that the rights of G have accrued pursuant to Article 537(3), and that B may not cancel the contract without the consent of G as per Article 538(2).

The articles state that the provisions of Section 11 Bailment apply mutatis mutandis to entrustments of business that do not constitute juridical acts, but the query suggests that the provisions regarding mandate of juridical acts do not apply mutatis mutandis to such entrustments. There is no mention of mandate in the articles, and the query seems to be making a different assertion than what is stated in the articles. Therefore, the answer is 'N' for no.

Article 509 prohibits the obligor of certain obligations from duly asserting a set-off against the obligee, unless the obligee acquires a claim corresponding to the relevant obligation from another person. The scenario described in the query involves a person who holds a monetary claim and has borne an obligation for compensation for loss or damage for injury to the obligor of that monetary claim. If the obligation for compensation falls within the scope of Article 509, then the person may not duly assert a set-off using the monetary claim against the obligation for compensation, unless the obligee acquires a claim corresponding to the obligation for compensation from another person. Therefore, the answer is 'Y'.
