Article 94 establishes the nullity of a false manifestation of intention made in collusion, which means that such a manifestation made by an agent or principal will result in the voidness of the contract. Article 101(1) further explains that, in determining the validity of a manifestation of intention made by an agent, the absence of intention, mistake, fraud, or duress, as well as the knowledge or negligence of any specific circumstance, should be considered. 

Therefore, the counterparty can still assert the invalidity of the contract, even if the principal knew about the false manifestation, since the focus of the inquiry is on the agent's manifestation of intention, not the principal's knowledge of the false manifestation."

A person with qualified legal capacity has the ability to perform legal acts on their own behalf, while a person with limited legal capacity may require assistance or supervision to perform certain legal acts.\n\n- What is an agency relationship and how does it work?\nAn agency relationship is a legal relationship where one person (the agent) acts on behalf of another person (the principal) with the principal's consent. The agent has the authority to make legal decisions and perform legal acts on behalf of the principal, and the principal is bound by the actions of the agent.\n\n- What is rescission of a contract and when can it occur?\nRescission of a contract is the act of canceling or terminating a contract. It can occur in certain situations, such as when there is a mistake, fraud, duress, undue influence, or incapacity on the part of one of the parties.\n\n- What is an act performed by an agent and how does it relate to rescission of a contract?\nAn act performed by an agent is a legal act that is carried out by the agent on behalf of the principal. If the agent had the authority to perform the act and did so in accordance with the principal's wishes, the principal is bound by the act and cannot rescind the contract based on their own incapacity.\n\n- Can a contract be rescinded by a principal after it is performed by an agent with a counterparty even if it turns out that the agent was a person with limited capacity?\nNo, a contract cannot be rescinded by a principal after it is performed by an agent with a counterparty even if it turns out that the agent was a person with limited capacity. This is because the act performed by the agent is considered to be the act of the principal, and if the agent had the authority to perform the act, the principal is bound by it regardless of the agent's capacity. However, if the agent did not have the authority to perform the act or acted outside the scope of their authority, the principal may be able to rescind the contract.""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Given the above, does the query follow from the articles? Please first explain your reasoning, then say 'Y' for yes and 'N' for no. You have had enough time to ask for more information, now you have to pick 'Y' or 'N'.

While Article 102 states that an act performed by an agent may not be rescinded on the grounds of qualified legal capacity, this applies only if the agent had the authority to perform the act. If the agent did not have the authority, the principal may be able to rescind the contract. Additionally, Article 120 states that an act that is voidable on the grounds of limited legal capacity may be rescinded by the person with qualified legal capacity, including a legal representative of the person with limited capacity. However, the query asks whether a guardian of an adult with limited capacity can rescind a contract after it is performed by an agent, which is not addressed by the articles. Therefore, my answer is 'N'.

A sales contract is a legally binding agreement between two parties where one party agrees to transfer ownership of a particular asset, such as a piece of property, to the other party in exchange for compensation.\n4. Ownership transfer refers to the legal process of transferring ownership of a piece of property from one party to another.\n5. The defense of requirement for perfection is a legal concept that is used to protect a subsequent purchaser of immovable property from claims by a prior purchaser who failed to register their ownership.

Article 242 provides that the owner of immovables acquires ownership of a thing that has been attached thereto as its appurtenance, while Article 243 provides that if two or more movable properties with different owners can no longer be separated without damage due to accession, the ownership of the composite thing belongs to the owner of the principal movable property.\n\n4. The conclusion reached in the query logically follows from the application of the legal principles or rules from the articles to the situation described.

Subsection 5 Merger further elaborates on the conditions of extinguishing the claim when an obligee is also an obligor.

If a buyer or subsequent acquirer incurs expenses with respect to immovables, the seller must reimburse those expenses in accordance with the provisions of Article 196; provided, however, that with respect to beneficial expenses, the court may, at the seller's request, grant a reasonable period of time for the reimbursement.\n- Article 595: The borrower bears the ordinarily necessary expenses of borrowed thing.

If a period for the redemption is agreed upon, no further extension may be effected subsequently. If no period for the redemption is agreed upon, the redemption must be effected within five years.\n\n3.

The query pertains specifically to a borrower and a leased thing, while the articles primarily address the sale, redemption, possession, and borrowing of property in general, as well as the rights and obligations of the parties involved in these transactions. While there are some provisions in the articles that relate to the reimbursement of expenses, these provisions do not directly address the specific situation described in the query.

Article 697 establishes the principle of benevolent intervention in another's business, which requires a manager to manage a business for another person in a way that best suits the interests of the principal. However, this principle applies only to cases where a person has begun to manage a business for another person without being obligated to do so. In the case of B repairing A's hedge, it is not clear whether B has begun to manage A's business or whether B has any obligation to repair the hedge. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the claim in the query follows logically from the articles.

This scenario relates to the issue of benevolent intervention in another's business and the circumstances under which a manager can demand reimbursement of expenses incurred while engaging in such intervention. According to Article 697, a manager must engage in benevolent intervention in a way that best suits the interests of the principal, and may claim reimbursement of beneficial expenses only to the extent that the intervention has enriched the principal.
