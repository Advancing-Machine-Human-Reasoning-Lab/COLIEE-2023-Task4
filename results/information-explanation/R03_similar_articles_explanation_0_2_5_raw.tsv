The query provides that A's manifestation of intention to cancel did not reach B due to a problem with the communication system, and asks whether it is effective. Since the articles state that the manifestation of intention is effective only when notice is received by the other party, and that the failure to receive notice due to a communication problem is not a legitimate reason for it to be deemed received, the query does not follow from the articles.

The query asks whether B can file an action for preservation of possession against A in the given scenario, even if one year has passed since the start of construction, before the construction is completed. 

The articles state that an action for preservation of possession can be filed as long as the danger of obstruction exists, and that the provisions of the proviso to the first paragraph of Article 201 apply mutatis mutandis if the possessed thing is likely to be damaged by the construction work. Therefore, B can file an action for preservation of possession against A in the given scenario, since the danger of obstruction exists and B is seeking to preserve their possession of their own land, which is likely to be affected by the construction work.

Based on this reasoning, the answer to the query is 'Y'."

It is not clear from the query whether B manifested the intention to own the movable X to A or not. 

However, the query also mentions that B made an agreement with A to purchase X from A and transfer A's right of possession. This indicates that B is taking steps to acquire a new title to the movable X with the intention to own from that point forward.

Therefore, the final answer is 'Y'."

- The lessee can exercise the right of retention to secure reimbursement of beneficial expenses.
- The lessor can request a reasonable period of time for reimbursement, which could lead to the extinguishment of the right of retention.

Therefore, the query 'In cases where a lessee of a building has exercised a right of retention to secure reimbursement of the beneficial expenses after the termination of the lease, the right of retention will be extinguished if the court grants a period of time for the reimbursement at the request of the lessor.' follows logically from the articles.

A statutory lien is a type of security interest that arises by operation of law, rather than by agreement between the parties. It gives the holder of the lien a right to retain possession of a specific asset until a debt is repaid.\n\n6. The indivisibility of statutory liens means that the lien holder has a right to retain possession of the entire asset, even if only part of the debt has been repaid. This is relevant to the query because it suggests that a pledgee may not be able to demand reimbursement for necessary expenses from the possessor of the pledged thing if the debt has not been fully repaid.\n\n7. The articles do not explicitly address the rights of third-party collateral providers in relation to reimbursement, but Article 350 suggests that the provisions of Articles 296 through 300 and Article 304 apply mutatis mutandis to pledges, which may include third-party collateral providers.\n\n8.

Legal Terms:\n- Compensation: payment made to someone to compensate for loss, injury or damage suffered.\n- Loss: the result of a negative outcome or damage suffered.\n- Damage: harm or injury caused to a person or property.\n- Non-performance: failure to fulfill an obligation or a duty.\n- Monetary value: the amount of money that something is worth.\n- Deduction: subtraction or removal of an amount from a total.\n- Interim interest: interest that accrues on a loan or other debt between the date of the loan and the time when the borrower is expected to make the first payment.\n- Payment: the act of giving or receiving money in exchange for goods or services.\n- Money: currency that is recognized as a medium of exchange in a particular country.\n\n2. Analysis: \nThe articles (Article 417 and Article 415) and the query are related to the issue of compensation for loss or damage arising from non-performance. Article 417 provides that unless a particular intention is manifested, the amount of compensation for loss or damage is determined with reference to monetary value. On the other hand, Article 415 provides that if an obligor fails to perform a contractual obligation, the obligee may claim compensation for loss or damage arising from the failure. The query suggests that the only method to satisfy the compensation for loss or damage is payment of money.\n\n3. Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis of legal terms and the provisions of the articles, it is logical to conclude that the query is consistent with the legal principles and rules established by the articles. This is because compensation for loss or damage arising from non-performance is typically awarded in the form of monetary compensation, as stated in Article 417.

While the articles outline the circumstances under which compensation for loss or damage may be awarded for failure to deliver money, they do not specifically address the payment of a loan pursuant to a monetary loan agreement. Furthermore, the articles explicitly state that the defense of force majeure cannot be used to avoid the obligation of the obligor to pay compensation for loss or damage related to the delivery of money. Thus, it is not clear whether force majeure could be used as a defense in the case of failure to pay a loan pursuant to a monetary loan agreement. Therefore, the answer is 'U'.

The articles do indicate that the obligor may not raise the defense of force majeure when it comes to the compensation for loss or damage for failing to deliver money, and it is arguable that this provision extends to the failure to pay a loan under a monetary loan agreement.

Therefore, the query that ""the agreement on the penalty is presumed to be an agreement on payment of a certain amount of money in addition to the compensation for the actual damage due to non-performance"" follows logically from the articles.

The articles define liquidated damages as an amount of money agreed upon by parties in advance to cover damages that may be incurred as a result of a breach of contract. Liquidated damages are intended to be a reasonable estimate of the actual damages that would be suffered if one party fails to perform their obligations under the contract. The articles also state that a penalty is presumed to constitute liquidated damages.

Based on these definitions, it is not accurate to say that an agreement on a penalty is presumed to be an agreement on payment of a certain amount of money in addition to compensation for actual damages. Instead, an agreement on a penalty is presumed to be an agreement on liquidated damages, which are intended to be a reasonable estimate of the actual damages that would be suffered if one party fails to perform their obligations under the contract.

The articles state that an ""assumption of obligation not releasing an obligor may also be effected by a contract between the initial obligor and the person that becomes the additional obligor."" The articles do not explicitly discuss the scenario where the Initial Obligor does not give consent to an Additional Obligor being added to the obligation.

However, based on the legal terminology and relationship described in the articles, it can be inferred that an Additional Obligor cannot be added to an obligation without the Initial Obligor's consent, because a direct contract between the Obligee and the Additional Obligor must be governed by provisions concerning Third-Party Beneficiary Contracts. This implies that the Initial Obligor must participate in the process that leads to the addition of an Additional Obligor.

In this case, claim X has been attached by D before claim Y was acquired by B. Therefore, even if claim Y arose from a cause that existed before the attachment, claim Y was acquired by B after the attachment, which means B cannot duly assert against D a set-off based on claim Y against claim X.

The articles state that an obligor may assert a set-off against an assignee based on a claim against the assignor that the obligor acquired after the time of the completion of the perfection if the claim is a claim that has arisen from a cause that existed before the time of the completion of the perfection or a claim that has arisen from a contract under which the claim acquired by the assignee has arisen. However, in the given scenario, B acquired claim Y after the requirements for perfection of the assignment have been satisfied, and it is not clear whether claim Y has arisen from a cause that existed before the time of the completion of the perfection or from a contract under which the claim acquired by the assignee has arisen. Therefore, there is not enough information in the articles to determine whether B can duly assert against G a set-off based on claim Y against claim X. The answer is 'U'.

However, the articles only state that the obligee may immediately cancel the contract without making the demand referred to in the preceding Article if the purpose of the contract cannot be achieved unless the obligation is performed at a specific time on a specific date or within a certain period of time, and the obligor fails to perform the obligation at that time or before that period of time expires. The articles do not mention that the contract will be extinguished by operation of law in such cases. Therefore, there is not enough information in the articles to determine whether the query follows logically from them. The answer is 'U'.

The articles state that a buyer may cancel a contract for non-conformity of the subject matter delivered if the non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to the seller, but do not provide a direct answer to the query. However, the articles do state that a buyer cannot cancel a contract for non-conformity of the subject matter delivered if the non-conformity is due to grounds attributable to the buyer (Article 562). Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that if the insufficiency in the quantity of the subject matter delivered is due to grounds attributable to the buyer, the buyer cannot cancel the contract. However, if the insufficiency in the quantity of the subject matter delivered is due to grounds not attributable to either party, it is not clear from the articles whether the buyer may cancel the contract.

Therefore, the query is consistent with the provision of Article 563(2)(i) that a buyer may request a price reduction if delivery of the replenishment is impossible, and with the provision of Article 563(2)(iii) that if the purpose of the contract is unable to be achieved unless the performance is carried out at a specific time, the buyer may request a price reduction if the seller fails to cure the non-conformity of the performance at the time or before the period expires.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Given the above, does the query follow from the articles?

This situation falls under Article 563(2)(i) of the law of sales, which allows the buyer to request a reduction of the price if it is impossible to cure the non-conformity of performance. Also, it seems that the purpose of the contract is unable to be achieved unless the performance is carried out at a specific time, which could be considered as an exception under Article 563(2)(iii) that allows the buyer to request a price reduction. Therefore, based on the information provided, the query follows logically from the articles. Answer: 'Y'.

In general, a minor may not be held liable for damage they inflict if they did not have the capacity to appreciate their own liability for that act, as stated in Article 712, but this does not exclude other forms of liability. Additionally, a person with parental authority over a minor may be liable for damage the minor inflicts, as per general principles of civil liability.

Article 196(1) states that if a possessor returns a thing in their possession, they may claim reimbursement for costs paid for preservation and other necessary expenses, but not for ordinary and necessary expenses if they have acquired fruits. Article 196(2) allows a possessor to claim reimbursement for costs paid to improve the thing in their possession and other beneficial expenses, but only if there is a current increase in value. However, this provision does not apply to a possessor in bad faith, as stated in the same paragraph. Therefore, the query is correct in stating that B, who possessed land X in bad faith, may not claim reimbursement for ordinary and necessary expenses related to land X when it is returned to A.
