The query states that A is not liable to C as an unauthorized agency if C was negligent in not knowing that A had no authority to represent, even if A knew themselves to have no authority to represent.

While the articles do not explicitly discuss this scenario, they do provide guidance on the impossibility of performance and the effectiveness of a contract. According to Article 412-2, if the performance of an obligation is impossible in light of the contract or other sources of claims and the common sense in the transaction, the obligee may not request the performance of the obligation. Additionally, Article 415 provides that if the performance of an obligation is impossible, the obligee may claim compensation for loss or damage arising from the failure to perform the obligation. Based on this guidance, it is possible to reason that if the subject matter of a contract is destroyed before the contract becomes effective, the performance of the obligation may be impossible, and the obligee may be entitled to claim compensation for loss or damage. Therefore, the answer is 'Y'.

Article 422 does not specifically mention destruction of the subject matter before delivery. However, it does mention compensation for loss or damage, which suggests that the destruction of the subject matter could be included. Therefore, we can assume that if the subject matter of an obligation is destroyed before it can be delivered, then the obligee (B) may have a claim against the obligor (A) for compensation for the damage.\n\n3. Article 422 states that if the obligee (B) receives compensation for the loss or damage, then the obligor (A) is subrogated to the thing or right by operation of law. This means that the obligee effectively transfers their claim for compensation to the obligor, who can then claim the compensation for themselves.\n\n4. Article 422-2 states that if the obligor (A) acquires a right or profit as a substitute for the subject matter of the obligation due to the same cause that rendered the performance of the obligation impossible, then the obligee (B) may demand the transfer of the right or reimbursement of the profit from the obligor. This suggests that if A receives insurance money as a substitute for X, B may be able to demand the transfer of that right or reimbursement for any profit acquired by A.\n\n5. As mentioned in the previous point, Article 422-2 suggests that if A acquires a profit as a substitute for X, then B may be able to demand reimbursement for the amount of damage sustained. However, this assumes that A has acquired a profit in relation to the destruction of X.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Given the above, does the query follow from the articles? Please first explain your reasoning, then say 'Y' for yes, 'N' for no, or 'U' if there is not enough information in the articles to determine.

Based on our analysis, it appears that the query follows from the articles. Article 422 allows for the subrogation of the obligee's claim for compensation to the obligor, while Article 422-2 allows the obligee to demand the reimbursement of the profit acquired by the obligor in relation to the destroyed subject matter. Therefore, if A received insurance money as compensation for the destruction of X, B would likely be able to demand the transfer of the right or reimbursement of the profit from A. Thus, the answer is 'Y'.

- As the destruction of X was caused by the negligence of a third party, the performance of the obligation has become impossible due to grounds not attributable to either party, and thus B may refuse to perform counter-performance.

Article 439 states that until the joint and several obligor that has the claim invokes a set-off, other joint and several obligors may refuse to perform the obligation to the obligee only to the extent of that joint and several obligor's share of the obligation.

The query asks whether an assignment of a deposit claim subject to a special agreement prohibiting assignment would be effective if the assignee was in bad faith or grossly negligent with respect to the special agreement. The articles address the assignment of claims subject to a manifestation of intention to restrict assignment, including claims for deposits, and provide that an obligor may refuse to perform the obligation to a third party that knew or did not know due to gross negligence that the manifestation of intention to restrict assignment was made. Therefore, bad faith or gross negligence may affect the validity of the assignment. Based on this, the answer is 'Y'.

There is no direct reference to third-party collateral providers in the articles.

Article 467 requires notice or consent to be given to the obligor or a third party in order to assert an assigned claim against them, and the notice or consent must be made using an instrument bearing a certified date. However, there is no mention of the requirement for perfection in relation to a subrogated claim.

Specifically, the articles refer to cases where the right transferred by the seller to the buyer does not conform to the terms of the contract, including cases where the seller fails to transfer part of a right that belongs to another person. 

Given this, it is possible to infer that the seller's failure to acquire and transfer the rights to the buyer would constitute a breach of contract, which would entitle the buyer to claim compensation for loss or damage or exercise the right to cancel the contract. However, it is not clear from the articles whether the seller may cancel the contract if the buyer knew that the rights did not belong to the seller at the moment of the contract. 

Therefore, the answer is 'U' (not enough information in the articles to determine)."

Article 415 allows the obligee to claim compensation for loss or damage arising from the obligor's failure to perform, and provides circumstances under which the obligee may claim compensation for loss or damage in lieu of the performance of the obligation. Article 564 clarifies that the provisions of Articles 541 and 542 (which allow the obligee to cancel the contract in certain circumstances) and Article 415 do not preclude the buyer from claiming compensation for loss or damage.""}, {'role': 'user', 'content': ""Given the above, does the query follow from the articles?

Therefore, even if there is a lawful sublease, the lessor can still exercise their rights against the lessee if necessary.\n\n3. Article 613(3) provides that if the lessee lawfully subleases a leased thing, the lessor may not duly assert against the sublessee the cancellation by agreement of the lease with the lessee, provided that the lessor did not have a right to cancel due to non-performance on the part of the lessee at the time of the cancellation. This means that if the lessor cancels the lease with the lessee by mutual agreement and they did not have a right to cancel due to non-performance by the lessee at the time of the cancellation, they cannot cancel the sublease with the sublessee.\n\n4. The query asks whether the lessor can assert cancellation against the sublessee even if they have a right to cancel due to non-performance on the part of the lessee at the time of the cancellation. According to Article 613(3), if the lessor had a right to cancel due to non-performance by the lessee at the time of the cancellation, they may assert cancellation against the sublessee as well.

According to Article 613(3), if the lessor had a right to cancel due to non-performance by the lessee at the time of the cancellation, they may assert cancellation against the sublessee as well. Therefore, the answer to the query is 'N' for no, as the lessor can assert cancellation against the sublessee if they have a right to cancel due to non-performance on the part of the lessee at the time of the cancellation.

According to article 655, the grounds of termination of mandate cannot be asserted against the other party unless the other party was notified of or knew of the same. Article 653 specifies that a mandate terminates when the mandator or mandatary is subject to an order commencing bankruptcy proceeding. However, the query does not provide any additional information regarding whether the mandatary was notified of or knew about the mandator's bankruptcy proceedings as required by law. Therefore, there is not enough information in the articles to determine whether the mandator can assert something against the mandatary after the termination of the mandate due to bankruptcy proceedings. The answer is 'U'.

Article 670(2) allows for the decision and execution of the partnership business to be delegated, but this does not change the fact that the partnership business is ultimately decided by the majority of the partners.

Article 187(1) of the Civil Code of Japan provides that a successor to a possessor may assert either the successor's own possession only or the successor's own possession together with that of the predecessor. Therefore, a universal successor to a possessor may also assert the successor's own possession only. Hence, the answer is 'Y'.
